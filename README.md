Only as my personal study.<br>

* [CNN.py](https://github.com/Mister5ive/tensorflow_CNN/blob/master/CNN.py): Create CNN model and train it by MNIST,then save the model.
* [CNN_Model_Restrore.py](https://github.com/Mister5ive/tensorflow_CNN/blob/master/CNN_Model_Restore.py): Restore CNN model and process the input.
* [digit_capture.py](https://github.com/Mister5ive/tensorflow_CNN/blob/master/digit_capture.py): Capture input digit by using opencv and recognize it by calling above model.
